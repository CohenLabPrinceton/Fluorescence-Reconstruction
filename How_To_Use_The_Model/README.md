This folder contains quick introductory code for new users who just want to figure out how to apply our U-Net models to a small sample image. 

Open up the Jupyter notebook called "Process_One_256x256_Image.ipynb". We provide for you a small sample image and model weights. The notebook will walk you through how to use the model and weights to generate a prediction image. 

For this simple demo, we provide a 256x256 pixel^2 image. If you want to check out the code for processing larger images using the sliding-window technique, this is provided here:
