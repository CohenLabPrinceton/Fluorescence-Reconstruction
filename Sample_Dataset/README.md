This folder contains a .zip file, with a subset of our MDCK 20x datasets for Fluorescence Reconstruction Microscopy (FRM) testing.

We provide 1000 input images (DIC), and corresponding fluorescent images with labeled nuclei (DAPI) and E-cadherin junctions (RFP). 
The cells stably expressed E-cadherin:RFP which enabled imaging of junctional fluorescence, while the nuclei were stained using Hoechst 33342 and imaged using a standard DAPI filter set.

Interested parties may find more complete information about our data collection methods in our paper.
